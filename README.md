# Time Series Forecasting Using ARIMA Model

## Data Source
The data used for this project was obtained from Yahoo Finance.

## Data Description
The dataset was initially analyzed and described to understand its structure and characteristics.

## ARIMA Forecasting Method

### ARIMA Model Overview
The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is used for forecasting time series data. It consists of three parameters:

- **p**: The order of the AutoRegressive (AR) term.
- **d**: The number of differencing required to make the series stationary.
- **q**: The order of the Moving Average (MA) term.

### Stationarity
To apply ARIMA, it is essential to check if the time series data is stationary. If the data is not stationary, we need to perform differencing operations to make it so. The minimum number of differencing operations required for stationarity is an input parameter for the ARIMA model.

## ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test)

### Purpose
The ADF test is used to check for stationarity in the time series. The null hypothesis for this test is that the series is non-stationary.

### Interpretation
- If the **p-value** from the ADF test is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the time series is stationary.
- If the **p-value** is greater than 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, meaning the series is non-stationary.

### ADF Test Result
From the ADF test, the p-value obtained was 0.533, which is greater than 0.05. Hence, we conclude that the time series is **not stationary**.

## Differencing and ACF Plot

To determine the order of differencing required, we used the **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** plots. These plots help identify how many differencing terms are needed to remove autocorrelation from the series.

After plotting the ACF, we determined the ARIMA model parameters as follows:
- **p** = 1
- **d** = 1
- **q** = 1

## Conclusion
After comparing the predicted values with the original time series, we observed minimal differences. Therefore, the predicted values align closely with the original ones, confirming that our ARIMA model provides accurate forecasts.
